Naive Base


SVM
Support vector machines are the best way pf dealing with data tranformed into vectors and 
evaluating the distance function from data points

Linear model play a staight of equation role which is the basis for most machine learning elements
Even neurons in neural networks.
A key trick in SVMs is the Kernal trick which projects data in increase dimensionality to generate linear relations
Paving path for non linear systemic resultant models.(In some terms a pseudo multilayer neural network)

Kernals = linear, rbf, sigmoid, poly, etc
Gamma = higher gamma with higher wiggly
C = tradeoff of smooth and number of trainng points inside curve
